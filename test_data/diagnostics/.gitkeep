# Diagnostic Test Data Directory
#
# This directory contains diagnostic snapshots exported from real Node runs.
# These snapshots are used for regression testing and integration verification.
#
# Files are JSON format with the following structure:
# - session_id: Random UUID (NOT NodeId - privacy preserving)
# - init_checkpoints: Initialization phase timings
# - lifecycle_events: Node lifecycle events
# - failures: Error events
# - router_health: Router integration status
#
# To generate test data:
# 1. Enable diagnostics in Node config
# 2. Run the node
# 3. Diagnostic snapshots will be auto-exported on shutdown
